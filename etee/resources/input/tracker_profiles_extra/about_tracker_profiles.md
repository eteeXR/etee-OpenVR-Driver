etee_tracker_spi_input_profile.json is an input profile which allows the SPI communication of input data from the controller (connected to the tracker) to be used. This input profile can be enabled by referencing in the tracker json profile. When used, disable the custom controller driver. The input profile contains all the same inputs as the main controller profile except for skeleton data.
